JWT -> Json Web Token

As it is one of the famous security mechanism, that which allows you to 
secure restful webservices w.r.t. proper authentication. 

It will generate a key which is known as bearer token, based on that one we need to give permission to the specified urls, where authentication and authorization takes place. 

What is Authentication

What is Authorization 

JSON contains 3 parts as 

(i)    Header
(ii)   Payload
(iii)  Signature 

JSON web token stores the data in encrypted format, as it supports CORS Policy (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) 

It supports HMAC or HS256 hashing algorithm to Encrypt or Decrypt the data.
